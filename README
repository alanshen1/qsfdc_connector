This package contains source for two methods for accessing a Salesforce.com instance via Qt/KDE:

1) an implementation of QSqlDriver/QSqlResult for Salesforce.com that can be used to build, among other things,
   a QSqlQueryModel displaying the contents of a Salesforce "object" (table), with a sample program that uses it.

2) a KDE Akonadi Contact resource that uses the Contacts table in a Salesforce.com instance as a data source

Dependencies:
A recent version of gSoap (at or above 2.7.10) is required, as well as a Salesforce "Partner WSDL" (you can download
this from under the Setup menu in your instance).  Edit soap/CMakeLists.txt to reflect the path to this file.

Compiling:
mkdir build
cd build
cmake [-DGSOAP_BUILD_DIR=/path/to/downloaded/gsoap-X.Y/gsoap] ..
make
sudo make install

(As of version 0.1 "make install" only installs the Akonadi resource.  To try the sample QSqlDriver program, run "main/main" directly)

Directory structure:
The "soap" directory contains the inputs to gSoap.
The "lib" directory implements the QSqlDriver/QSqlResult subclasses using the code built in the "soap" directory.
The "sfakonadi" directory implements the Akonadi resource using the code from the soap directory.
The "main" directory contains a sample program that uses the QSqlDriver/QSqlResult subclasses to create a QSqlQueryModel
    for the Contacts object of a user's Salesforce instance.

Licensing:
Everything except the "main" directory is licensed under the LGPL, v2.1.
The contents of "main" are licensed under the GPL, v2 "or later".
